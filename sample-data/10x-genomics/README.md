# 10x Genomics sample data

All data from 10x Genomics' [dataset resources](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets).

‚ö†Ô∏è note: many apps and/or devices struggle with multi-hundred megabyte TIFF images. You may need specialized software such as [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) to visualize the input TIFFs. May the force be with you. ü´°

Selected portion, approx 2300 √ó 1675; HER2 channel (channel #2 of 3). [Breastcancer.org](https://www.breastcancer.org/pathology-report/her2-status) says "HER2 proteins are receptors on breast cells". So (I think) this image shows the membranes (outer layers) of breast cells. ([full size image](preview-human-breast-20221103-418mb/selectedregion_input_image_channel_HER2_small.png))

Same portion, with all membrane & nuclear channels combined. Blue is membrane and green is nucleus. ([full size image](preview-human-breast-20221103-418mb/selectedregion_deepcell_input_image_small.png))

## Note: naming convention

The samples don't have concise IDs, for example: `human-prostate-cancer-adjacent-normal-section-with-if-staining-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0`

We need something brief, descriptive, and unique-ish.

We'll use: `<tissue type>-<publish date>-<tiff MBs>`

eg `human-prostate-cancer-20210727-725mb`

If multiple tissue types are published on the same date, we'll either revisit or rely on the filesize to disambiguate. ü§î
