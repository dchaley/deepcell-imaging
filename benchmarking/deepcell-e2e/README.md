# End-to-end DeepCell benchmark

**Objective**: measure how long it takes to process an image, varying the image size & resource allocation.

(define processing here; tldr: load input channels + run predict)

(insert some benchmarking tables and charts here)

## Test data provenance

# Method
## set up
- Provision a GCP Vertex AI managed notebook instance
  - Connect to the instance using the link `OPEN JUPYTERLAB`
  - set idle time to 10 min
    
- Clone the repo
    - in jupyter, go to the github icon, and check "clone repo" and "download repo"
    - download [github repo]https://github.com/dchaley/deepcell-imaging.git
 
- Set the notebook runtime to `tensorflow 2.10 (local)`
    - But something is off with the kernel? See also: https://github.com/dchaley/deepcell-imaging/issues/59

- Installing dependencies
  - Run [the notebook](deepcell-e2e-benchmark.ipynb), which installs dependencies documents the configuration parameters
    - If you install dependencies this way, you need to restart the kernel after the pip install.
    - Just run, restart, and re-run â€“ it should be fine.
  - Or create a setup notebook which includes the cell that installs the dependencies. Run this notebook first. Then we don't have to restart the kernal of the notebook for benchmarking. https://github.com/dchaley/deepcell-imaging/issues/67
    
## Running the benchmark
- adjust the machine type as needed
- adjust the input_channels_path parameter to the location of the input image
- run the whole part.
- cp & paste the output to the csv file that records the benchmark
- record the benchmark results in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mHeKZqoH0-XrrV_P0uTwXNrwQCkcM6lbTZKGmMYKb8k/edit#gid=0
